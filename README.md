## Getting Super Powers

## Stay hungry, stay foolish.

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

好好学习，天天向上

```
$ give me super-powers
```

```
$ whoami
$ Brick Mover
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
 keep healthy, 坚持锻炼身体。
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

hello\_world

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="hello\_world.py" %}
```python
print("hello world")
```
{% endcode %}
